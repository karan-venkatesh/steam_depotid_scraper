        Install
        -------
        
        For system specific details, see `Installation Details <http://steam.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html>`_.
        
        Install latest release version from PYPI:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # with SteamClient dependecies
            pip install -U steam[client]
        
            # without (only when using parts that do no rely on gevent, and protobufs)
            pip install -U steam
        
        Installing directly from ``github`` repository:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # cutting edge from master
            pip install git+https://github.com/ValvePython/steam#egg=steam
        
            # specific version tag (e.g. v1.0.0)
            pip install git+https://github.com/ValvePython/steam@v1.0.0#egg=steam[client]
            # without SteamClient extras
            pip install git+https://github.com/ValvePython/steam@v1.0.0#egg=steam
        
        Vagrant
        -------
        
        The repo includes a `Vagrantfile` to setup enviroment for expermentation and development.
        We assume you've already have ``vagrant`` and ``virtualbox`` set up.
        The VM is ``Ubuntu 16.04`` with all necessary packages installed, and virtualenv for ``python2`` and ``python3``.
        
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            vagrant up    # spin the VM and let it setup
            vagrant ssh
            # for python2
            $ source venv2/bin/activate
            # for python3
            $ source venv3/bin/activate
        
        
        
        Local Testing
        -------------
        
        To run the test suite with the current ``python``, use
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            make test
        
        To run for specific version, setup a virtual environment
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            virtualenv -p python3 py3
            source py3/bin/active
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            make test
